# Handwritten Symbol Recognition
Handwritten Symbol Recognition


Two programs in this repo: 
train.py
test.py

Pytorch and CUDA dependencies needed.

Use the train.py file to train the network.

Test the results with the test.py file

Image and label files included are a sample due to the size of upload file limits on Github. The original used 23503 images. Here I have trimmed that to 5000.
