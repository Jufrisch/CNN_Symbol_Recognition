# Handwritten Symbol Recognition
Handwritten Symbol Recognition


Two programs in this repo: 
train.py
test.py

Pytorch and anaconda default dependencies needed.

Training takes about 7 minutes on our GPU and sends to cuda.  

Use the train.py file to train the network.

Test the results with the test.py file.

Please change the code in the main() function for accuracy testing. There is code there already to test the first 250 images. 
Change the path on lines 134 and 136 to the test set path. The test_func(img) function will take an array of images and assign each image label 
and save to a 1D numpy array.
